# Systematism Beyond Design Systems 01.2020

#### Do I need a system?

Popular axiom in current discourse around systems states: “we are all already using systems without being aware of it“.
While on the rise, this opinion is far from nascent. Almost 50 years ago, in his book Systemantics 2, John Gall began discussing how large organizations that control governments and religions, operate as systems we all participate in, whether we are conscious of it or not.

So what can we learn from the systems we currently use in our life, that we can apply to our work? We certainly have all experienced the frustration of systems that do not work well (notoriously, the DMV for example), so why do systems fail and when should we seek to create one?

As seductive as living in a world in which every task corresponds to a system might sound, most workflows are better suited without a system. Let's examine some characteristics a task (or the input of a system) must have to be suitable candidates for a systematic approach.

Systems perform incredibly well for a certain type of task . These workflows have three common traits: repetition (high-volume), longevity (medium to long lifespan), and a finite set of use cases (high-confidence), that can be iterated against programmatically (automation). Let's examine each in more detail.


#### Repetition & longevity

Like any investment, systems are subject to economic rules. In particular, they suffer from high marginal costs in the short term, which taper off in the medium and long periods, and they reach financial viability only after their marginal returns surpass their marginal cost.
Systems which have too short of a lifespan never reach economic maturity and therefore are not a convenient solution to the task they are set out to solve.


#### Finiteness & automation

Systems process their work through on a set of rules defined by their creator. By design, systems are simple computational machines which do not deal well with uncertainty: if a case is unknown, the system will not know how to react and will stop processing. A simple set of rules is exceptionally important for a system to operate fast and efficiently. Looser rules allow for quicker computational speed and for more flexibility in handling edge cases, as seen in the case of abstract systems.
Highly efficient systems rely on automation to process information faster and more accurately. A system with a high number of strictly defined rules is more likely to “jam” than a system with a few, more flexible mandates.

While the above is true for most cases, emerging technology is developing systems which are explicitly built to deal with uncertainty. These open-ended systems can take any input from a certain domain and make a judgment call in regards to the output, even in absence of instructions which contemplate that particular use case. For example, they are able to analyze photos or videos 3 and return a multiplicity of information.
